ArrayList Notes

  An Array List is a based on the array data structure with the main difference being that is has a dynamic length.

    ex: const array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

  Primary built in array methods:
    .push(10) - adds a new value to the end of the array
    .unshift(10) - adds a new value to the begining of the array
    .pop() - removes and returns the last value in the array
    .shift() - removes and returns the first value in the array


  Time Complexity:
    Accessing: O(1)
    Searching: O(n)
    Inserting: O(n)
    Deleting:  O(n)

  Pros: 
    - Dynamic size
    - Methods created come built in

  Cons:
    - Can only store objects
    - Requires more memory to use and upkeep
